## How to operate the Factory for making pacmen

First, clone this entire repository.
Then open the html file in a browser.
When button "make one" is pressed a new pacman is created with a certain velocity and random position. 
It is then added to the array of pacmen, which keeps track of the position and velocity of each pacman.
Each pacman bounces off any wall it hits, then reverses action.
